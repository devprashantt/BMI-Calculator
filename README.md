BMI Calculator

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a personâ€™s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. A high BMI can indicate high body fatness. BMI screens for weight categories that may lead to health problems, but it does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an individual.

Advantages of BMI

1 - BMI helps measure the obesity rate in people.

2 - Observing the changes in BMI values help the doctors evaluate the obesity levels in people over time.

3 - When the BMI of a significant population is calculated, it helps researchers gather data that can be used to examine the obesity epidemic.

4 - It helps researchers determine the pattern of dietary that results in obesity in a large group of people.

5 - Knowing the BMI value of an individual, doctors can mitigate the health risks arising due to obesity.
